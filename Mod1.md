Technical writing to me means text that is used to give instruction or spread a certain type of information. 

I've never done any sort of coding before so that portion will be a bit more difficult to get used to. Reading the directions over and slowly going through the github page has made things slightly easier to understand. 
I can see the interface becoming easier to navigate after using it for a while, seeing a new layout to learn just takes time to get used to.
